<h1>Booklit</h1>

<p>Booklit is a documentation authoring tool designed to be <a href="index.html#sections">flexible</a> in how you organize your content and <a href="index.html#extending">extensible</a> so that patterns can emerge and be optimized as your documentation grows.</p><h2>Sections</h2>

<p>Sections can be organized however you want, rather than conforming to a rigid hierarchy. They can be embedded within each other, split into separate pages, omitted from table-of-contents listings, all on a section-by-section basis.</p><p>Broken references, malformed documents, and invalid method calls are all caught at compile-time.</p><h2>Extending</h2>

<p>Documents are written in a language that can be extended via plugins written in Go. As patterns emerge in your documents, you can optimize for them by quickly writing a plugin and pulling it in.</p>
