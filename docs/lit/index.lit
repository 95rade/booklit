\split-sections

Booklit is a documentation authoring tool designed to be
\reference{sections}{flexible} in how you organize your content and
\reference{extending}{extensible} so that patterns can emerge and be optimized
as your documentation grows.

\table-of-contents

\section{
  \title{Flexibility with Sections}{sections}

  Sections can be organized however you want, rather than conforming to a rigid
  hierarchy. They can be embedded within each other, split into separate pages,
  omitted from table-of-contents listings, all on a section-by-section basis.

  Broken references, malformed documents, and invalid method calls are all
  caught at compile-time.
}

\section{
  \title{Extending your Documentation}{extending}

  Documents are written in a language that can be extended via plugins written
  in Go. As patterns emerge in your documents, you can optimize for them by
  quickly writing a plugin and pulling it in.
