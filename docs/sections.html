<h1>1 Flexibility with Sections</h1>

<p>Sections can be organized however you want, rather than conforming to a rigid hierarchy. They can be embedded within each other, split into separate pages, omitted from table-of-contents listings, all on a section-by-section basis.</p><p>Broken references, malformed documents, and invalid method calls are all caught at compile-time.</p>
